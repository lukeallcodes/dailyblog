        <h3>Second Post - Life Update </h3>
        <p> Well I'm here again, kinda just ran into the repo as I was looking through past side projects. I'm currently building <a href = "recount.pro">recount.pro</a> from the ground up and the development has been going swimmingly. I've finally been able to
          utilize the practice that I've been putting in the past six months in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. I haven't touched react in a while, I'm not solid enough in JS to warrant that kind of toolset. My understanding of C, C++ 
          have only helped me along the way. Well, I should start generating the code to get information from the database for the site and that could take all day to develope with a good mile walk around the park included. have a good one, bye for now.
